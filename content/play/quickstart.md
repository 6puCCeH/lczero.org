This document describes how to set up Lc0 as a chess engine to play locally on your computer.


If you want to play online instead, to go [page about playing online]( {{<ref "playonline">}}).


This will be written later, for now read [this outdated post in our blog](https://blog.lczero.org/2018/09/guide-setting-up-leela-on-chess-gui.html).

Also [that page](/dev/wiki/getting-started/) will probably be encorporated into this page.
