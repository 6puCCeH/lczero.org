Some of them have already been solved and are listed for "historical documentation", while others are still being investigated.

* [[Large Elo fluctuations starting from ID253]]  
  Appearing in "old main" training run. Related to oversampling and solved.
* [[Missing Shallow Tactics]]

  Analysis of "spikes" appearing in the monitored scalars in training run 10.
* Relatively worse performance in season 13 due to [[TCEC S13 issues]]
