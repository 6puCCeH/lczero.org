There are several known issues with Leela Chess Zero play and training runs.
Some of them have already been solved and are listed for "historical documentation", while others are still being investigated.

* [[Large Elo fluctuations starting from ID253]]  
  Appearing in "old main" training run. Related to oversampling and solved.
* [[Missing Shallow Tactics]]
* [[Dubslow's analysis of Test 10 problems]]  
  Analysis of "spikes" appearing in the monitored scalars in training run 10.
* Relatively worse performance in season 13 due to [[TCEC S13 issues]]
