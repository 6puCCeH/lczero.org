v0.17.0 is out of "release candidate" status, and now is fully released!

Can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/releases/tag/v0.17.0).

It has no changes relative to RC2. For the list of differences relative to
v0.16, see posts for
[v0.17.0-rc1](../../../2018/08/lc0-v0170-rc1-has-been-
released.html) and
[v0.17.0-rc2](../../../2018/08/lc0-v0170-rc2-has-been-
released.html).

It is encouraged now that everyone who contributes training games, switches to
version v0.17.0.

After the [network training
reset](../../../2018/08/test10-learning-rate-has-been-
lowered.html) (which is probably few weeks from now), only version v0.17 will
be accepted. This is because v0.16 has [rule50 encoding
bug](../../../2018/08/rule50-encoding-bug-is-found.html).
